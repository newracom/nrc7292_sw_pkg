Change summary for version 1.5:

    * Multi-STA rate control (RC) for AP (v1.5)
      o Configured by module param, 'ap_rc_mode'

    * RSSI-based rate control (RC) for STA (v1.5)
      o cli_app set rc_pf <1|2> (This should be done before the Wi-Fi connection.)

        2: RSSI based RC

    Changes
    * Coverage enhancement by using 1/2MHz MCS0 frame on 2/4MHz channels
