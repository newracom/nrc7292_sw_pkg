Change summary for version 1.4.1:

    Changes
        * Enhanced dynamic vendor IE to encompass probe request/response and association request frames
        * Configuration for beacon transmission rates
        * Introduction of Continuous TX mode
        * Elimination of the K0 band and restoration of K1/K2 for backward compatibility
        * Expanded support for up to 1000 STAs
        * Support 1MHz primary channel location of 4MHz AP/STA
        * Avoidance of fragmented data frames in strong/mid RF field

        * Extended supported Linux kernel version: up to 6.1.x

    Bugfix
        * Scan failures in the K2 band
        * Incorrect usage of the CTS format for RTS with RI 1 (NDP-Response) in open mode AP
        * cli_app: if duty cycle setting fails, it is now disabled, and an error is returned to the cli_app
        * Multicast frame's SN is non-sequential when duty cycle is enabled
        * rmmod failure which can occur due to target malfunctions or SPI issues
        * Beacon loss handling at the uCode
        * Kernel panic that may occur when adding a large number of vendor IEs
        * Fixed ch_switch_cnt number in the case of hidden SSID AP
        * Heap leakage during the updating of beacon frames
        * WDT reset that could occur during frequent ifconfig up/down operations on the AP
        * Kernel panic that could occur when the enable_beacon_bypass feature is enabled
        * Failure of connecting to an AP with TW country code
        * PN order mismatch for big-size packet transmission
        * iw scan meshid command failure
        * 2MHz secondary CCA operation

    Known Issues
        * Not Support 5 US channels due to hostapd channel capacity reason
          (Not supported channel: 100(BW_1M, 925.5MHz), 104(BW_1M, 926.5MHz),
          108(BW_1M, 927.5MHz), 112(BW_2M, 927MHz), 116(BW_4M, 926MHz))
        * Due to the legacy Wi-Fi/HaLow channel mapping, "hostapd_cli chan_switch" command experiences a 60-second delay when using radar channels below:
          5500(#100/925.5MHz), 5520(#104/926.5MHz), 5540(#108/927.5MHz),
          5560(#112/927MHz), 5580(#116/926MHz)
        * DHCP failure or delay in multi-hop MBSS
          (Recommend using static IP in more than 3-hop MBSS)
